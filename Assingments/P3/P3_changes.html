        <p>Our client is an interest group for informatics students at NTNU Trondheim. Ontap is an interest group for students who like brewing beer. 
            When we got an assignment from our lecturer to build a website. 
            Our group sent an email asking Ontap if they wanted us to build a new website for them. They wanted a website, so we sat up a meeting, where they explained what they were requiring from this website.</p>

        <h4>How To</h4>
            <p>
                On the "Hot To" page we decided to have the outher box in in a light-blue color and the inner in a dark-blue color. 
                This was in order to have page look as similar to the other pages as possible. On figma you can see the outher box in a dark-blue color and the inner in light-blue.
                Here we have a theme that goes across all the pages of the site, thus making the site feel 
                completed and planned out.
            </p>

            <h4>Slideshow</h4>
            <p>
                In the minimum requirements it was specified that the slideshow would be automatic, with the ability to change slide whenever the user wanted, with
                the use of buttons. We figured that for a better user experience it would be better to abandon the idea of an automatic slideshow. We found that
                it was frustrating to have the slide automatically change, if we wanted to read the text and observe the image. Therefore we ended up with a 
                slideshow that only changes when the user wants it to, by clicking buttons.
            </p>
        
        <h3>Additions</h3>
        
        <h4>Navbar</h4>
            <p>
                In the navigationbar we initially had lines under each of the subsections of the site. This is illustrated in Figma. We changed this because we found not to be the most asteticly pleasing design.
                What page you are on the website is indicated by a light-blue background-color on the current subsection on the navbar. This was made in order to make it easier for the user to understand where he/she is at any moment.
            </p>
        <h4>Kontakt Oss</h4>
            <p>We desided to add a page to our site called "Contact us". This was in order to have page where the user could easily reach out to ontappd. The user types in his/her name, subject and message. 
                When everything is filled out the user can hit send and is then directed to his/her mail. From here the user can easily edit the message or just send it.
                In addition we needed the site to have anoter distinct js funtion. 
            </p>
        <h4>Checklist on How To</h4>
            <p>
                We decided to add a checklist on the "How To" page in order to let the user have easy controll over the process of making the beer as he is watching the videos on the page.
                Another reason for this was in order to have one more distinctive js function.
            </p>
        
        <h4>Additional JS files</h4>
            <p>We decided to add a seperate js file for each of the pages on our site in order to make it easier to navigate and understand what functions belonged to what site.
            We still have a single js file "script.js" whith all the funcions that are present on each of the pages on the site. This was in order to ensuere modularity. This pages includes the topbox, navbar and footer.
            The new js files that were added consists of the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>abv.js</li>
                <li>howTo.js</li>
                <li>kontakside.js</li>
                <li>main.js</li>
                <li>promille.js</li>
                <li>spleise.js</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h3>Removals</h3>
        <h4>Navbar underlining</h4>
            <p>
                In the navigationbar we initially had lines under each of the subsections of the site. This is illustrated in Figma. We changed this because we found it not to be the most asteticly pleasing design.

            In order to ensure we fulfilled the requirement for modularity we made a js file called "script.js" which had all the functions that were present on more than one page. 
            This includes the navigationbar which can send the user to all the different pages on our site, the topbox with the Ontappd logo and the two beers, and the footer which has links to Ontappd on different platforms.
