        <p>
            In order to insure we fulfilled the requirement for modularity we made a js file called "script.js" which had all the functions that were present on more than one page. 
            This includes the navigationbar which can send the user to all the different pages on our site, the topbox with the Ontappd logo and the two beers, and the footer which has links to Ontappd on different platforms.
