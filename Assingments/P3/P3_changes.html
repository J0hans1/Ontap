            <p>Our client is an interest group for informatics students at NTNU Trondheim. Ontap is an interest group for students who like brewing beer. 
                When we got an assignment from our lecturer to build a website. 
                Our group sent an email asking Ontap if they wanted us to build a new website for them. They wanted a website, so we sat up a meeting, where they explained what they were requiring from this website.

            <h4>Promille kalkulator</h4>
            <p>
                We have changed the style of the radio buttons. The buttons in Figma were rounded but 
                the buttons in our actual website are squared with a border radius. We have changed the 
                style because our website contains alot of squares and we thought that squared radio buttons 
                would make our webdesign more consistent.  
            </p>

            <h4>How To</h4>
            <p>
                We have decided to change the name of "how to" page to "Brygge selv" because in this page we have som tutorials about brewing. 
                And "Brygge selv" would represent the page better than "How to"
                On the "How To" page we decided to have the outher box in in a light-blue color and the inner in a dark-blue color. 
                This was in order to have page look as similar to the other pages as possible. On figma you can see the outher box in a dark-blue color and the inner in light-blue.
                Here we have a theme that goes across all the pages of the site, thus making the site feel 
                complete and planned.
            </p>

            <h3>Additions</h3>

            <h4>Navbar</h4>
            <p>
                In the navigationbar we initially had lines under each of the subsections of the site. This is illustrated in Figma. We changed this because we found not to be the most asteticly pleasing design.
                What page you are on the website is indicated by a light-blue background-color on the current subsection on the navbar. This was made in order to make it easier for the user to understand where he/she is at any moment.
            </p>

            <h4>"Phone mode"</h4>
            <p>
                When the page becomes very small, the logo becomes a compressed version, where "Ontaps bryggelaug" is removed. this gives a smaller section dedicated to the logo.
                The navbar becomes a dropdown menu, with an arrow pointing to downwards, to indicate that if activated, the menu will open downwards. When menu is activated. the buttons will show in a box, and the arrow at the bottom points upwards, to indicate
                that the menu will close upwards.
            </p>

            <h4>Kontakt Oss</h4>
            <p>
                We decided to add a page to our site called "Contact us". This was in order to have page where the user could easily reach out to ontappd. The user types in his/her name, subject and message. 
                When everything is filled out the user can hit send and is then directed to his/her mail. From here the user can easily edit the message or just send it.
                In addition we needed the site to have anoter distinct js funtion. 
            </p>

            <h4>Checklist on How To</h4>
            <p>
                We decided to add a checklist on the "How To" page in order to let the user have easy controll over the process of making the beer as he is watching the videos on the page.
                Another reason for this was in order to have one more distinctive js function.
            </p>

            <h4>Additional JS files</h4>
            <p>
                We decided to seperate the individual scripts for each side, from the main script that all the pages have in common. we called these unique scripts components and organized them into a folder with the same name.
                with the same name js file for each of the pages on our site in order to make it easier to navigate and understand which component belonged to what site.
                We still have a single js file "script.js" whith all the funcions that are present on each of the pages on the site. This was in order to ensuere modularity. This pages includes the topbox, navbar and footer.
                he new js files that were added consists of the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>abv.js</li>
                <li>howTo.js</li>
                <li>kontakside.js</li>
                <li>index.js</li>
                <li>promille.js</li>
                <li>spleise.js</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Removals</h3>
        
            <h4>Phone number:</h4>
            <p>
                We have removed the phone number from the footer. Because our client "Ontap" does not have a phone number.
            </p>
            <h4>Navbar underlining</h4>
            <p>
                In the navigationbar we initially had lines under each of the subsections of the site. This is illustrated in Figma. 
                We changed this because we found it not to be the most asteticly pleasing design.
            </p>

            <h4>Slideshow</h4>
            <p>
                In the minimum requirements it was specified that the slideshow would be automatic, with the ability to change slide whenever the user wanted, with
                the use of buttons. We figured that for a better user experience it would be better to abandon the idea of an automatic slideshow. We found that
                it was frustrating to have the slide automatically change, if we wanted to read the text and observe the image for a longer time. Therefore we ended 
                up with a slideshow that only changes when the user wants it to, by clicking buttons.

                Naqib made the "spleise kalkulator". He also contributed alot on the design of the website through CSS. Benjamin made the how to page with vidoes and text. 
                Here he also made a checklist JS function that lets the user easily have controll over where they are in the process of making the beer.
                Sander made the slideshow in JS for the main page of our website. Oskar fulfilled his minimum requirements by making the the footer in JS. He also made abv calculator, aswell as the function for sending a mail on "kontakt oss".

                In order to ensure we fulfilled the requirement for modularity we made a js file called "script.js" which had all the functions that were present on more than one page. 
                This includes the navigationbar which can send the user to all the different pages on our site, the topbox with the Ontappd logo and the two beers, and the footer which has links to Ontappd on different platforms.
                This was primarily done by Markus and Oskar, but everyone played a part here helping each other.

                We are aware of an issue in Safari, where the slideshow sometimes does not show the fading animation. We have tried both with and without the webkit prefix and
                neither of the soulutions worked. When we asked "Studass" for help they said that it is known that animations have issues in Safari. Therefore we can not guarantee
                optimal performance when using Safari.
