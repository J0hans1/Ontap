        <p>Our client is an interest group for informatics students at NTNU Trondheim. Ontap is an interest group for students who like brewing beer. 
            When we got an assignment from our lecturer to build a website. 
            Our group sent an email asking Ontap if they wanted us to build a new website for them. They wanted a website, so we sat up a meeting, where they explained what they were requiring from this website.

        <p>
            A brief summary of the questionnaire you send out to testers, as
            well as the link to the Google Form you used. Don't forget to ask your client to test
            the website.

            The questions we used could be put into three categories. First what kind of device they were testing from and
            what browser they used. This information is very important to us as we can see if we have concrete problems with a
            certain device or browser. The second category would be who they are and how they fit our target audience. If 
            the user giving feedback is in our target audience their opinion might be more useful than someone who is not
            in our target audience. The last category would be the feedback itself. This is of course important to let us
            know what the user thought was good, bad and what could be changed. We used both live testing and testing via
            a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc46WabCvrsqcHzo0RofaGYm-1VU4LF3_l-lBXSQSdsH58BUQ/viewform?usp=sf_link">Google Form</a>.

                Tester Audience
            </h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            A description of your efforts to reach testers that are similar to the
            website's intended audience and how successful you were (give the percentages of
            your tester audience once you aggregate their answers, e.g., 23% of college
            students, 46% school administrators, etc.) If you are collecting age-ranges, you can
            do the same. If you were able to do live testing with a few users, describe that as
            well.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to get the feedback we needed for our website it was important to have testers that love to breew beer or want to do so in the future.
            Based on this we decided to ofcourse test the webiste with some of the memebers of Ontappd.

        <p>
            Step back and reflect on the whole project experience and what you
            learned from it. Are there general lessons that you learned, beyond the
            nuts-and-bolts of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript? We would like you to take this
            seriously and be thoughtful about your comments, but there is no right or wrong
            answer here, so don't feel that you have to flatter us or try to divine what we want to
            hear.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our experience of this project as a whole is that it can be extremely valueable to work on some bigger projects like this from time to time.
            We all feel we have learned alot trought the whole process. From planning the project, to working on the design in Figma, and then finally coding the whole website.
            It has been great working a team where we can all help each other out when someone is stuck on something, as well as learning so much from each other.
            We can now truly see how much work that goes into some bigger projects and how inportant it is to work in teams in order to divide the work on each other.
            We have experienced both how good and bad GIT can be sometimes. But in general we have come a long way learning about it.
