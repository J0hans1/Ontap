        <p>Our client is an interest group for informatics students at NTNU Trondheim. Ontap is an interest group for students who like brewing beer. 
            When we got an assignment from our lecturer to build a website. 
            Our group sent an email asking Ontap if they wanted us to build a new website for them. They wanted a website, so we sat up a meeting, where they explained what they were requiring from this website.

            The questions we used could be put into three categories. First what kind of device they were testing from and
            what browser they used. This information is very important to us as we can see if we have concrete problems with a
            certain device or browser. The second category would be who they are and how they fit our target audience. If 
            the user giving feedback is in our target audience their opinion might be more useful than someone who is not
            in our target audience. The last category would be the feedback itself. This is of course important to let us
            know what the user thought was good, bad and what could be changed. We used both live testing and testing via
            a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc46WabCvrsqcHzo0RofaGYm-1VU4LF3_l-lBXSQSdsH58BUQ/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">Google Form</a>.

        <p>
            Our target audience is Informatics students that are interested in brewing wine or beer. 
            This is quite a small target audience and therefore it was somewhat difficult to find testers that fit both of these two categories. 
            We did however find some that fit both categories and some that fit one of them. We did this by purposely selecting people that fit either one or both of the categories. 
            If they didn't fit any of the categories we seeked out other people that would be better fitted to test for us. This meant that we didn’t get as many testers as we could have, but the quality of the feedback was much better as all of our testers either were studying informatics or were interested in brewing. 
            Out of the total number of testers, 50% were students at NTNU studying Informatics, 40% were students from another study program, and 10% were full-time employees. Out of the total number of testers, 90% were interested in brewing, and 10% were not.</p>

            We have tested our website on a couple of diffrent platforms. This was done in order to make sure the website works on other devices than just Chrome. 
            This will allow users to access the webiste on different devices and stil have a great user experience. 
            These include:

        <h3>Changes</h3>
        <p>
            Most of the testers like the overall design of the website. It was in a similar style with recurring elements throughout the entire website, which satisfied the testers. We got some comments about the color-scheme not being to some people's liking, but we won’t change this due to our clients wishes. He wished that the color scheme matches the color scheme of Online (the informatics students association). 
        </p>
        <h3>Navigation</h3>
        <p>
            The general feedback from our testers is that the website is well organized and easy to understand and navigate. We had a comment that one of our testers wanted a cursor pointer when hovering over the navigation bar so that it would be very clear that the different buttons led to some other page of the website. Other than that we did not get to 
        </p>
        <h3>Content</h3>
        <p>
            Testers found the overall content of the website to be great. It contained most of what they were wondering about regarding brewing. We did however get some comments regarding “gravity” in the “ABV-kalkulator”. Some people requested a better explanation of that, and some also requested it be translated to Norwegian like the rest of the page is. 
        </p>
        <h3>Usability</h3>
        <p>
            Many of our testers are especially impressed with our contact page that takes you to your standard email provider and fills out the information from the form that the user filled in. The testers were also generally positive to our other JS functions such as the various calculators, the slideshow and the tasklist. Other than that there was some feedback regarding being able to write characters other than numbers in the input fields on the calculator in some browsers.
        </p>
        <h3>Client's thoughts</h3>
        <p>
            Our client was generally really happy with the final result. He was happy that our design was clean and matched his requirement of having a similar style and color-scheme to Online’s website and also being easy to navigate and understand. While he would have preferred that we used other technologies that would make the page more modern and user-friendly, he knew that it was off limits and was satisfied by the way we used the technologies that were available for this project. He was also very impressed by our responsive design, especially that we had a menubar that became a dropdown menu on the mobile version. As critique he mentioned that he would have liked to see a warning that said you probably wrote something wrong if you had very high output values in the different calculators.

        </header>
        <p>
            In order to improve our website based on the feedback we got during the testing phase we have come up with some concrete things we can change in the future, some of which have already been changed in the final version.
        </p>
        <h3>Ontappd Logo</h3>
        <p>
            The Ontap logo on our topbox had no other function than being a logo. We got some feedback that it would be better if the logo took the user back to the main page of the site. This is a very common feature on many websites and it will be one of our first priorities.
        </p>
        <h3>Favicon</h3>
        <p>
            Having a favicon is a small touch that one of our testers missed. This is an easy fix that will add just a small touch to the site to make the website look more polished.
        </p>
        <h3>Slideshow</h3>
        <p>
            The slideshow worked fine, but we noticed that some of our testers did not notice that you are able to click on the pictures in order to change what picture you want to see. We changed the sentence at the bottom to make this more clear in the final version. In the future we could make the “next picture” buttons stand out more so that all the users of the site will know that you can view different pictures, just by looking at it and not needing to have read the entire paragraph next to it.
        </p>
        <h3>Autofocus</h3>
        <p>
            Sometimes due to the autofocus feature when you open a calculator and the input field is not visible from the very top of the page, the browser will automatically jump down to the input field. Some users noted that this was confusing as they didn’t understand where they were or how they got there. This could be fixed by removing the autofocus feature.
        </p>
        <h3>Header</h3>
        <p>
            Some users noted that the header was way too big. They said it looked nice but it was unnecessarily big and made them have to scroll down the page every time. To fix this we could make the header smaller, so that the user can more easily see more of the site right away and not have to scroll down in order to use the functionality of the site. This most likely would also fix the problem we had with autofocus, and allow us to keep this neat feature. 
        </p>
        <h3>Cursor on Navigationbar</h3>
        <p>
            While the navigation bar gets highlighted when you hover over it, the cursor still is the standard pointer variant. Some testers would have liked to have seen the clicker cursor which is standard when you hover over a link. We agree that this is better aesthetically, and is also a quick fix. 
        </p>
        <h3>Font size on mobile </h3>
        <p>
            The size of some of the text such as the explanation of different units in “Promillekalkulator” and the tasklist was quite big for some of the testers and took up more space than it needed in the mobile version. We still want the unit explanation to stand out from the text, so what we could do is make the text bold and a bit smaller on mobile.
        </p>
        <h3>Input/Ouput issues</h3>
        <p>
            The calculators don't really care how high of a number you put in the calculators. It would be nice if the user got an alert that said something like “Are you sure you put in the right numbers?” when the output was either much higher or lower than what is to be expected. This would be easy to implement with an alert and an if-statement in JavaScript. We also had some validation issues with certain browsers. We only used HTML-validation, and this issue could most likely be resolved with JavaScript.  
        </p>
        <h3>Text</h3>
        <p>
            We had some complaints about the text of our website. Firstly, there were quite a bit of spelling errors and some grammatical errors. This is something we fixed in the final version, because it made the website look much more professional. Secondly, there was a bit of confusion regarding “gravity”. Some requested it being in Norwegian as the rest of the website, while others requested a better explanation of what gravity was. “Gravity” is a common term in brewing and there isn’t really a good commonly used Norwegian translation in the context of brewing. We should however add a better explanation or refer to the videos which explains the whole process more thoroughly. Lastly, some testers also think that the text would be more readable if we split different parts of the text content into separate paragraphs. This is of course understandable and should be fixed.

        </header>
        <p>
            Our experience of this project as a whole is that it can be extremely valuable to work on some bigger projects like this from time to time. 
            We all feel we have learned a lot throughout the whole process. From planning the project, to working on the design in Figma, and then finally coding the whole website. 
            It has also been valuable to see how testing works, and that things that are obvious to us, might not be as obvious to the end user and vice versa. 
            It has been great working as a team where we can all help each other out when someone is stuck on something, as well as learning so much from each other. 
            We can now truly see how much work that goes into some bigger projects and how important it is to work in teams in order to divide the work between each other. 
            We have experienced both how useful Git can be if you use it properly, but also how frustrating it can be if something goes wrong, as it sometimes does when you are a beginner using Git. 
            The most important takeaway from using Git is: ALWAYS BRANCH. In the end we have learned a lot by failing, but this has made us more aware of what not to do and has helped us become better.
