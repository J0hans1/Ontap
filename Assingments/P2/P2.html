            <p>Our client is an interest group for informatics students at NTNU Trondheim. Ontap is an interest group for students who like brewing beer. When we got an assignment from our lecturer to build a website. Our group sent an email asking Ontap if they wanted us to build a new website for them. They wanted a website, so we sat up a meeting, where they explained what they were requiring from this website.</p>

                The main purpose of this website, is to act as a homepage for the Ontap-group. It will also serve as a toolbox for Ontap-brewers, through the functional requirements of the site. The main goal, is to create website that will catch the interest of the audience, and make it easier for new ontap-members to get started with the brewing.

                The structure of how the user will get around on the webpage will be through a navigationbar that is on the top of the page.
                Here we will have a Ontapped logo, title of the webpage, "About", "Calculator" and "How To". When the user the user is on either one of 
                "About", "Calculator" and "How To", the one the user is on will disappear. This is in order to make sure the user will not be able to click a dead link.
                <br>
                <br>
                We have chosen this layout becuase it is clean and there are few subpages/links on the page. It is therefor allways easy to se where you are on the webpage
                and easy to get anywhere.
                <br>
