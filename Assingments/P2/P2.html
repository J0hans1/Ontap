        <p>Our client is an interest group for informatics students at NTNU Trondheim. Ontap is an interest group for students who like brewing beer. When we got an assignment from our lecturer to build a website. Our group sent an email asking Ontap if they wanted us to build a new website for them. They wanted a website, so we sat up a meeting, where they explained what they were requiring from this website.</p>

            The main purpose of this website, is to act as a homepage for the Ontap-group. 
            It will also serve as a toolbox for Ontap-brewers, through the functional requirements of the site. 
            The main goal, is to create a website that will catch the interest of the audience, and make it easier for new ontap-members to get started with the brewing.

                Navigation Structure
            </h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            The structure of how the user will get around on the webpage will be through a navigationbar that is on the top of the page.
            Here we will have a Ontapped logo, title of the webpage, "About", "Calculator" and "How To". When the user the user is on either one of 
            "About", "Calculator" and "How To", the one the user is on will disappear. This is in order to make sure the user will not be able to click a dead link.
            <br>
            <br>
            We have chosen this layout becuase it is clean and there are few subpages/links on the page. It is therefor allways easy to se where you are on the webpage
            and easy to get anywhere.
            <br>
            See example under ""

        <p>
            When we tried to find out our universal design, we had keep in mind that Hjalti wanted the webiste to have the colors of online. 
            This is in order to make sure the users understand that Ontapped is a part of Online. There are also some beers on either side of the logo. 
            This was made in order to show what goes on on the site.

            <p>
            We plan to fullfil the Minimum requirements in of javascript by making three calculators:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h4>Promille kalkulator:</h4>   
                    This is a calculator that will allow the users to calculate how much alcohol they have in their
                    bodys.
                    The users have to choose their gender, enter their wieght, when they started to drink and how
                    many drinks they have had. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>ABV% kalkulator:</h4>  
                    This calculator will calculate approximately how alcohol our beer will contain after the brewing.
                    But we have not figured out what kind of information we need from the users. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>
                        Pris kalkulator:
                    </h4>
                    This one is a calculator that calculates the price per person. The users have to enter how many
                    people they are that are going to brew together, they also have to enter how many liters of beer
                    they have brewed and how much did it cost in total. The calculator will calculate how many
                    liters of beer every person gets. it will also calculate the price per person and price per
                    liter.   
                </li>
                <li>

                    <p> 
                        This slideshow will be shown at the index page. It will include multiple pictures of equipment that Ontap has available and that the user can borrow, and other pictures that are related to Ontap such as picture. Ontap will supply us with these pictures, so there wonâ€™t be any issues with copyright.

        <p>
            We will be using the following table of work divison and list of files and folders to organize our workload and deadlines. 
            There are also some missing images from the list because we are still waiting for Ontappd to send them to us.
            We expect to receive the images sometime in week 41. Furthermore, the group has chosen to keep all CSS and
            JavaScript code in singular documents. This means every person will be responsible for a section in the JavaScript file,
            rather than every person having their own separate JavaScript file.
