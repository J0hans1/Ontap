        <p>Our client is an interest group for informatics students at NTNU Trondheim. Ontap is an interest group for students who like brewing beer. 
            When we got an assignment from our lecturer to build a website. 
            Our group sent an email asking Ontap if they wanted us to build a new website for them. They wanted a website, so we sat up a meeting, where they explained what they were requiring from this website.</p>

        <p>
            The main purpose of this website, is to act as a homepage for the Ontap-group. This is to bring all the ones who like brewing beers and other alcoholic beverages together.
            It will also serve as a toolbox for Ontap-brewers, through the functional requirements of the site. The site will include information about Ontap as a whole and information about to brew. This will mainly come as YT videos on the site.
            The main goal, is to create a website that will catch the interest of the audience, and make it easier for new ontap-members to get started with the brewing.

                Navigation Structure
            </h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            The structure of how the user will get around on the webpage will be through a navigationbar that is on the top of the page. 
            Here we will have a Ontapped logo with beers on each side of the logo, "Meny", "How To" and the three different calculators("ABV%", "Promillekalkulator" and "Kostnadskalkulator").
            <br><br>
            We have choosen to use a hierarchical structure where the user all the time can move form a general level to the specific levels and vice versa. The main page will be the most general, and "how to" as aswell the three differet calculators will be more specific. 
            The user can from the navigatinbar choose to visit either one of the subsections. When the user the user is on one of the subsections of the webpage, the one the user is on will have a darker shade of blue than the rest of the Navigationbar. 
            This is in order to make sure the user easily can understand where he/she is on the website.

                Page Layout and Appearance

        </header>
        <p>
            When we tried to find out our universal design, we had keep in mind that Hjalti wanted the webiste to have the colors of online. 
            This was in order to make sure the users understood that Ontap is a part of Online. The colors unite the two. There are also some beers on either side of the logo. 
            This was made in order to show what goes on on the site. This was a fun touch to make the site feel more alive and fun. 
            The navigationbar has a darker shade of blue in order to break away from the main color. This is to add more detail to the site.
            <br>
            <br>
            By having the same navigationbar on the top of the page for alle of the pages on the site, there is a clear red line that the users follow on all the different subsections on the site.

        </header>
            <p>
            Our website will have five separate pages: 
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li> 
                    <h4>Homepage.html:</h4>
                    When the users will visit our website, this is the page they will see. In this page
                    our users can read about Ontap and it's history. The footer will contain Ontap's contact
                    informations such as phone nummber, email address and slack link. The same footer will be 
                    inculded in every pages of our website. We also inculded Online's logo at the right side of the
                    footer. This page will also feature a slideshow of pictures that are related to Ontap, which you
                    can read more about in the minimum requirments.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>promillekalkulator.html:</h4>
                    In this page we will have a calculator that will calculate alcohol level in your body. The users 
                    can access this page by clicking on the (promille kalkulator) on the menuebar. This calculator
                     will have three inputs where
                    the users have to gave the required informations to the program in order for program to calculate
                     the alc level. We also have an output were the program wil excute the result.
                     
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>ABV.html</h4>
                    In this page we have another calculator, which allows users to calculate how much alcohol
                    your beer will contain after brewing. This means the users use this calculator before they start
                    brewing. The users can access this page by clicking (ABV% kalkulator), on the menuebar. This
                    calculator will also have some inputs for users to enter informations for the program. But
                    we do not know yet what kind of informations this calculator requires from the users, and how
                     many inputs deos it need.
                    
                    
                     

                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Priskalkulator.html</h4>
                    This page is yet another calculator. Users can access this calculator by clicking (Pris kalkulator) on the menuebar. 
                    In this page users will be able to calculate price/per liter beer. we will include three inputs for users 
                    to enter the required informations. And of course we have outputs for the program to execute the result. Til now it looks 
                    like this calculator needs three outputs. Becuase it will execute three different results.  
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>How to:</h4>
                    This page will feature several videos that will show the user different steps when making beer. These videos
                    will be embedded to the web page and will come from YouTube. The videos will help people that are new to
                    brewing, by giving them a guide on how to get started. Hopefully this will engage the user to learn more
                    about brewing and maybe even get engaged with Ontap.

                Minimum Requirements
            </h2>
            <p>
            We plan to fullfil the Minimum requirements in of javascript by making three calculators and a slideshow:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h4>Promille kalkulator:</h4>   
                    This is a calculator that will allow the users to calculate how much alcohol they have in their
                    bodys.
                    The users have to choose their gender, enter their weight, when they started to drink and how
                    many drinks they have had. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>ABV% kalkulator:</h4>  
                    This calculator will calculate approximately how much alcohol the beer will contain
                    after the brewing. This is information that is very useful when brewing beer and 
                    therefore a great tool to have on the website. The formula for ABV% is quite 
                    complicated and uses a specific formula. WE have not yet figured out what kind of 
                    information we need from the users, but Ontap ensured us in our first meeting that
                    they will send us the formula they usually use in time for our project. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>
                        Pris kalkulator:
                    </h4>
                    This one is a calculator that calculates the price per person. The users have to enter how many
                    people they are that are going to brew together, they also have to enter how many liters of beer
                    they have brewed and how much did it cost in total. The calculator will calculate how many
                    liters of beer every person gets. it will also calculate the price per person and price per
                    liter.   
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Slideshow:</h4>
                    <p> 
                        This slideshow will be shown at the index page. It will include multiple pictures of equipment that Ontap
                        has available and that the user can borrow. It will also include other pictures that are related to 
                        Ontap such as pictures of the brewing process, the finished beer, and more. The slideshow will be made 
                        using JavaScript and feature timed slides, but also buttons that will allow the user to change picture 
                        if they want to do it faster than what is timed.  Ontap will supply us with these pictures, so there 
                        won’t be any issues with copyright.

            </h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            Our plan for building the website consists of delegating tasks between all the programming languages we will be using. The website will need at least 3 HTML documents, 4 javascripts documents and 1 CSS document. We also need to find videoes for our "How to"-page and get photos from Ontappd.
            We will probably need two people to create the three HTML documents and two people to create the javascripts. The last person can create the the CSS stylesheet which will be used for all the HTML documents.
