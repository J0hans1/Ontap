        <p>Our client is an interest group for informatics students at NTNU Trondheim. Ontap is an interest group for students who like brewing beer. When we got an assignment from our lecturer to build a website. Our group sent an email asking Ontap if they wanted us to build a new website for them. They wanted a website, so we sat up a meeting, where they explained what they were requiring from this website.</p>

            The main purpose of this website, is to act as a homepage for the Ontap-group. 
            It will also serve as a toolbox for Ontap-brewers, through the functional requirements of the site. 
            The main goal, is to create a website that will catch the interest of the audience, and make it easier for new ontap-members to get started with the brewing.

        </header>
        <p>
            The structure of how the user will get around on the webpage will be through a navigationbar that is on the top of the page.
            Here we will have a Ontapped logo, title of the webpage, "About", "Calculator" and "How To". When the user the user is on either one of 
            "About", "Calculator" and "How To", the one the user is on will disappear. This is in order to make sure the user will not be able to click a dead link.
            <br>
            <br>
            We have chosen this layout becuase it is clean and there are few subpages/links on the page. It is therefor allways easy to se where you are on the webpage
            and easy to get anywhere.
            <br>

        <p>
            When we tried to find out our universal design, we had keep in mind that Hjalti wanted the webiste to have the colors of online. 
            This is in order to make sure the users understand that Ontapped is a part of Online. There are also some beers on either side of the logo. 
            This was made in order to show what goes on on the site.

            </h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            Our plan for building the website consists of delegating tasks between all the programming languages we will be using. The website will need at least 3 HTML documents, 4 javascripts documents and 1 CSS document. We also need to find videoes for our "How to"-page and get photos from Ontappd.
            We will probably need two people to create the three HTML documents and two people to create the javascripts. The last person can create the the CSS stylesheet which will be used for all the HTML documents.
